BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM ARGUE WITH YO MAMA

벌써 백번 넘게 들은듯 진짜 개좋다

Pay attention at the beginning of this song and the ending of baptized in fear omg

Been following him from his start. My favorite singer and he truly is The Artist / The Singer of the 21th Century. ❤ Love his voice.

Nah this should win album of the year at grammys

What if ? there is Michael Jackson in the voice of The Weeknd ? Tell me your opinion

Excelente...muy buen ritmo e invita a bailar.....

Album of the year.

So fucking good

Falling in love again!

Dawn fm and Hurry up tomorrow I love!🌌❤

I come from the future and all of The Weeknd's songs will be banned because all the young people there were acting strange while listening to them😢, enjoy while you can listen to these fantastic songs for free❤

I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold

Where do I start
When you open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars
When I open my arms
It's never еasy falling in love again

[Verse 1]
I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold
I told myself I would never get old, then you pulled me in close
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive again



 VFD1785_gwenstefani_whatyouwaitingfor_v3_YT

[Chorus]
Where do I start
When I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars
When I open my arms
It's never еasy falling in love again

[Post-Chorus]
Falling in, falling in love
It's nevеr easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
Falling in love again

[Verse 2]
Trapped inside a limbo, watching through a window of my soul
Suffering, I've been low, then I seen your halo
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive for another day

[Chorus]
Where do I start
When I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars (Cover my scars)
When I open my arms (Open my arms)
It's never easy falling in love again (Oh)

By far the best song on the album.

Does anyone else notice the similarity to one of Nigel's song

This song reminds me the electro music of 2015's omg

He never fell off like most others do! I really hope he links up with Timecop 1983 when he changes

Encarna azuaga me gusta  música sanadora

The Weeknd Open Hearts Lyrics 

[Verse 1]

I can hear the wind blow, even through the window

I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed

All the silver and gold only made my skin cold

I told myself I would never get old, then you pulled me in close

Oh, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]

Falling, angels call my name

But the things you say

Keeps me alive again


[Chorus]

Where do I start

When I open my heart?

It's never easy falling in love again

Cover my scars

When I open my arms

It's never easy falling in love again


[Post-Chorus]

Falling in, falling in love

It's never easy falling in love again

Falling in, falling in love

Falling in love again


[Verse 2]

Trapped inside a limbo, watching through a window of my soul

Suffering, I've been low, then I seen your halo

[Post-Chorus]

Falling in, falling in love

It's never easy falling in love again

Falling in, falling in love (Oh)

Falling in love again

I don't like the start of the song. It starts to abrupt. Besides that the song is just a masterpiece!!!

I will always wanna hear it after, Baptized in Fear 😅

[Verse 1]
I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold
I told myself I would never get old, then you pulled me in close
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, angels call my name

The Weekend meets New Order.

listen Baptize in fear and this one, exactly in this order

so GENIUS, loved the transition between songs

From morocoo❤❤❤❤

This has definitly played a role in his music career

Can't deny The Weeknd  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥

Genius

Beautiful ❤️ Transition+Combo Of 80 Style Music 
Feels Nostalgic Like Old Times Banging In My Head
Call My Name In This
Call Out My Name In Previous Old Album
Yeah The Weekend We Heard Your Name Been Called At Every Part Of The world 
Love From Pakistan 🇵🇰  South Asia  ❤

We got another best song of weekend before gta 6

I like this song!!! So spiritual ♥️ ❤️

This song seems like a sequel to after hours..

for me this is easily the best of the album

Imagine this. Two lovers in a top down convertible parked at a lover's lane overlooking downtown L.A. underneath a canopy of stars and this song playing through the speakers. Heaven is not out of reach tonight.

The transition from baptized in fear to open heart is insane🔥🔥

I swear everything this man creates is rare diamond 💎

Abel :)

i can feel the wind blow even through the window

Thanks Abel.

80's-ish with modern mastering. Havent heard the whole album yet so ill hold off on an evaluation.

This and baptized in fear should have been one song

❤

I could listen to this Forever

Tesfaye always on fire 🔥🔥🔥 ur music is lit af 😏💋

De los mejores discos que he escuchado en mi vida 🦋💙💪💙

Abel ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

perfection.

❤

I swear that there isn’t a song that I don’t like or I don’t feel it. This album it’s a masterpiece , a true experience.
Xo since 2014 ❤

i love THE weeknd

😍😍

❤❤❤❤

what a MASTERPIECE!

Wow.. awesome transition

Mad respect for this guy man. He grew on me. Carved his own lane 💪

Can't deny The Weeknd  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥

As always the best♥♥♥

This should’ve been the one and only single for the album, maybe timeless as well but the production on this song is so good.

Time changes things are getting faded 😢

Best of hurry up tomorrow

I feel like in a different era we'd hear the verse "Falling in, Falling in love." repeated till music cut at the end XD good times. The Weekend always give me such 80's vibes.

I grow up in the 1980’s and He’s got that 80’s sound that I love so much I have been a big fan since his very first album house of balloons

❤❤❤❤

🛐🛐🛐

This is not Blinding Lights of Hurry Up Tomorrow
This is even BETTER

Thanks... My everything ❤️

The scream at the beginning indicates this person's art.

Wowwwwww

CANT STOP LISTENING

Fact:
The signature of The Weeknd: Transition

This one is so catchy 👆🏼☝🏼

essa tá incrívelllllllllllllll

Lyrics: 

I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed

Oh, oh, oh

Falling, angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive again

Where do I start

Falling in, falling in love
It's nevеr easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
Falling in love again

Trapped inside a limbo, watching through a window of my soul
Suffering, I've been low, then I seen your halo

On everyone’s soul this is the perfect song on the album

Sounds like The Weeknd making a new order track

When he sings, it's never easy falling in love again, I feel it. It's tough falling in love with someone or something after a nasty scar.

I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold
I told myself
I would never get old, then you pulled me in close
Oh, oh-oh, oh

Fallin', angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive again

Where do I start?
When I open my heart?
It's never easy
Fallin' in love again
Cover my scars
When I open my arms
It's never easy
Fallin' in love again
Fallin' in, fallin' in love
It's never easy
Fallin' in love again
Fallin' in, fallin' in love
Fallin' in love again

Trapped inside a limbo, watchin' through a window
Of my soul
Sufferin', I've been low, then I seen your halo
Oh, oh-oh, oh

Fallin' angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive for another day

Where do I start?
When I open my heart?
It's never easy
Fallin' in love again
Cover my scars (cover my scars)
When I open my arms (open my arms)
It's never easy
Fallin' in love again (oh)
Fallin' in, fallin' in love
It's never easy
Fallin' in love again
Fallin' in, fallin' in love (oh)
Fallin' in love again

This album grows very eerily quickly on you even though it’s clear that it doesn’t try to. Something very authentic, soulful and inspiring.

GTA 6?

Can’t wait to see what song will be the theme for a future wrestlemania

Dont worry folks, The Weeknd will be back with a new concept album trilogy. But thank you Abel for all of this amazing music. You're a genius.

Abel, 🤴🏾Príncipe e 😇anjo, você diz aqui (Open Hearts 🎶)que: "Não é fácil se apaixonar de novo".
🤷🏻‍♀️ Se você não está apaixonado por ninguém, "Não" se apaixone ! Não precisa. 
Apenas, permita que o teu coração sinta o amor que uma fã APAI"❌️⭕️"NADA te envia todas as noites 🌬💕💕🤴🏾.

this is my fav from the album

Name song?

اتعب عشان تلاقي

The legend the goat

absolutely hit💔

from "save your tears to "cry for me", from "escape from LA" to "take me back to LA", from "i was never there" to "i can't wait to get there", from "heartless" to "open hearts"

Should released the apple vision version which is way more epic.

Album needed more songs like this.

Love it✨️✨️

Is this the absolute legend Max Martin on this? He is really at the top of the mountain in music

No gracias, hirió mis oidos, no integra la música con la voZ, está vez no amigo

❤️‍🩹

Amazing

is he saying "fallen angels" or "i'm falling, angels"

eres perfecto bb😔😔😔😔😔😔👍🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷💋💋💋💋

This song is my fav ❤️❤️❤️

Getting an add between baptised in fear and this is a crime against art from YouTube

The best in this drop 🫠

Fell in love on the first listen. Fuckk... song of the year easily!

The fact this song is almost 4 minutes long, but seems like it lasts about 2 just emphasises how much of a banger it is

goated track

I need a music video for this!

By far the best song in 2025 already

Mr. Tesfaye (The Weeknd ) is the ultimate endlessly greatest and best vocalist, singer, musician, artist, being, and thing that could ever possibly exist in any reality or imagination possible or impossibly, his vocals are endlessly the most greatest and best thing to ever exist, with his music, symphonies, harmonies, melodies, visuals, acting, and storytelling being the most incredible and wonderful thing that could ever possibly exist, he has the ultimate endless amount of talent and genius greater endlessly so more than any other artists and persons ever, all of his albums and songs and performances are endlessly the greatest and best possible since the beginning, but i think his new album “Hurry up, Tomorrow” is the greatest and best thing to ever exist, his vocals are endlessly the most unbelievably amazing thing ever even much more in live performances in this album as in all his art ever, and his music and acting and storytelling is the most genius and inconceivable thing ever, your live concert i attended in 2024 was the absolute greatest and best experience by a tremendous far that anyone could ever experience possibly, he is the only that could ever possibly surpass himself and he keep surpassing himself as he always has , no other beings or existences in any reality whether human, extraterrestrials or artificial “intelligence” ( if existent) could possibly ever surpass any of these , i can’t thank you enough dear Mr. Tesfaye for everything and i’m greatly   thankful that i happen to be able to witness the greatest and best thing that could ever exist possibly, and even more unfold in real time while i am alive , i wish you all of the best wishes always, you of course most deserve and should be the most popular ever being

Best song of the album! 😍♥️🥰👍🏼💯💯

*LISTENED TO THE ALBUM ON APPLE MUSIC THIS IS THE ONE I LIKE THE BEST ITS SO GOOD !!!! I LOVE IT AAAAAAA JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT OK BYE*

Kinda reminds me of Justice a little

Was this produced by Calvin Harris, it kinda sounds like it

If this is it for The Weeknd, what a run it has been. I basically grew up with The Weeknd, I remember being in 7th grade and during lunch this girl I was friends with, walks up to me with headphones on, tells me “listen to this” and it’s house of balloons by The Weeknd. 2012, and no one knew what he looked like, how things have changed, what a ride truly.

the best song of the album <3<3<3<3

we finally got it, i love u Abel

this is my favorite song from the album  nothing but Love

gotta be my favorite song of the album, thank you for this abel. 🔥

I waited 2 years for this track !

The music... yeah, I'm going to download it, as well as the other part after listening to the whole album.

WHY DID YOU SPLIT THIS GEM OF A SONG INTO TWO PARTS!? But I liked the transition

Wonderful🌌

here before million🔥🔥🔊🔊

I could instantly tell it was produced by Max Martin. The tastefulness is absolute!

The best ❤

I can’t even absorb the magnitude of this album yet. This is 80s sequel damn. So many good timeless songs. This is a bop.

This will be the biggest hit and I can't wait to see the music video !

I think it's going to be the official theme for WrestleMania 41

Una belleza

TRON beat type

I love this song so much

2020: Blinding Lights
2022: Gasoline
2025: Open Hearts

the king did it again<3 TORONTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JULY 27,28TH CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE WEEKND <3

This right here will be the resurgence of the 2010s EDM sound, and I am ready for it 🥹😭

The Album is Art on another dimension. This song will live forever among the stars. ♒

Crystal castles anyone?

Best song on this album

Chilllllllsssss yooo Abel just does it to me

the best song on the album

My girlfriend fw the weeknd do i marry her

Si jpourrais retrouver la meuf qui est passé après moi à l’apple store de la defense pour regarder le clip avec l’Apple vision pro. 
Celle qui m’avait fait le plus beau sourire jamais vu de ma vie quand je retira le casque.
Celle que j’ai ignoré comme un idiot.
C’est jamais facile de tomber amoureux … 😔

This is a mixture of great production and great artist

THANK YOU FOR THISS

All the Silver and Gold only make my skin cold! 🔥🏆

Qui croit aussi que ce sera aussi le tube de l'année ?

My favorite🩵🩵🩵💎💎💎

It is a whole connecting transition between these songs on the album.😭❤‍🔥

The Weeknd is the only person that can make non-generic radio music

Weeknd, i went to school with your shirt on, everybody ignored me

The only Weekend like song in the entire album, all the rest are slow placed and out of style IMO,

This is a love
Beautiful,  Just beautiful ❤

It's never easy falling in love agaaain!!

WAKE UP AND OPEN HEARTS, BEST TRACKS IN THE ALBUM

He basically took an 80s best and put vocals over it lol 😂

❤️

Besto Song ❤

❤

I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve replayed this gem, best on the album hands down.

Uff temazo

Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold
I told myself I would never get old, then you pulled me in close
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive again
[Chorus]
Where do I start
When I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars
When I open my arms
It's never еasy falling in love again

[Post-Chorus]
Falling in, falling in love
It's nevеr easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
Falling in love again

[Verse 2]
Trapped inside a limbo, watching through a window of my soul
Suffering, I've been low, then I seen your halo
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling, angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive for another day

[Chorus]
Where do I start
When I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars (Cover my scars)
When I open my arms (Open my arms)
It's never easy falling in love again (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
Falling in, falling in love
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love (Oh)
Falling in love again

nunca es fácil volver a enamorarse.

Best song in my opinion xo forever

The most shocking thing about this is that Madonna was working with Max Martin but abandoned the sessions to work with Stuart. Which while isn’t a bad thing, I just can’t fathom that she passed this track up. It’s incredible and top tier Max Martin

A masterpiece…..thank you Abel

okay the holiday okay

its finally here and its beautiful

The King is back!

Here before this blows up button

Now this is one song I’ve been waiting for😭

Released on my bday life is good 💜

Listening to the album, I notice that its main themes are: regret, fear of the end and farewell.

yeah this the 1…

genuinely breath taking piece of music.

Just when you about to run out of fresh stuff to listen to, The Weeknd drops these massive sound bombs.

The opening is wierd?

On repeat

Massive ❤

Eu amei todas as músicas!!!

2:34 ✊🏿🙂‍↕️

estranho pensar o tanto que a gente acaba se identificando com as músicas..

Nailed it, the Weeknd!!!

TO ALL MY AQUARIUS OUT THERE ,NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN LIFE …
The Weeknd is speaking to your inner ABEL , on this album ….

If you know , you know ….

THIS IS ALREADY THE SONG OF THE YEAR IN MY OPINION

ANOTHER BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM

This song make me cry 😭 

The Weeknd 🐐🚀

Dear Abel,If you see this comment I am from Ethiopia 🇪🇹 from your country, and I am  really passionate to be like you. I feel everything you feel before please can you help me to be like you. From: a brother that want to be like you.

i feel so emotional now that this is the end of his "the weeknd" era, this was the perfect end. he saved me yet once again and i can't describe enough how much i love this man and the music he makes. "fallen angels call my name but the things you say keeps me alive." ❤️

One of my favorites from this album

This is just extraordinary 🥀

ITS NEVER EASYYYYY

Mr. Tesfaye (The Weeknd ) is the ultimate endlessly greatest and best vocalist, singer, musician, artist, being, and thing that could ever possibly exist in any reality or imagination possible or impossibly, his vocals are endlessly the most greatest and best thing to ever exist, with his music, symphonies, harmonies, melodies, visuals, acting, and storytelling being the most incredible and wonderful thing that could ever possibly exist, he has the ultimate endless amount of talent and genius greater endlessly so more than any other artists and persons ever, all of his albums and songs and performances are endlessly the greatest and best possible since the beginning, but i think his new album “Hurry up, Tomorrow” is the greatest and best thing to ever exist, his vocals are endlessly the most unbelievably amazing thing ever even much more in live performances in this album as in all his art ever, and his music and acting and storytelling is the most genius and inconceivable thing ever, your live concert i attended in 2024 was the absolute greatest and best experience by a tremendous far that anyone could ever experience possibly, he is the only that could ever possibly surpass himself and he keep surpassing himself as he always has , no other beings or existences in any reality whether human, extraterrestrials or artificial “intelligence” ( if existent) could possibly ever surpass any of these , i can’t thank you enough dear Mr. Tesfaye for everything and i’m greatly   thankful that i happen to be able to witness the greatest and best thing that could ever exist possibly, and even more unfold in real time while i am alive , i wish you all of the best wishes always, you of course most deserve and should be the most popular ever being

[ Lyrics ] :-
I can hear the wind blow, even through the window
I can hear the whisper, even with my ears closed
All the silver and gold only made my skin cold
I told myself
I would never get old
Then you pulled me in close
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Fallen angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive again

Where do I start
When I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars
When I open my arms
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love
Falling in love again

Trapped inside a limbo
Watching through a window
Of my soul
Suffering, I've been low
Then I see your halo
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Fallen angels call my name
But the things you say
Keeps me alive for another day

Where do I start
When I open my heart?
It's never easy falling in love again
Cover my scars (Cover my scars)
When I open my arms (Open my arms)
It's never easy falling in love again (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Falling in, falling in love
It's never easy falling in love again
Falling in, falling in love (Oh-oh-oh)
Falling in love again

me encanta todo

TOOK ME BACK TO 2020‼️ THIS MAN REVISITED ALL OF HIS ALBUMS & PUT THEM ALL INTO 1‼️🔥 GREATEST SINCE MIKE🥲🔥 IM SAD THIS ERA IS COMING TO AN END‼️ THIS SOUND WAS ALL I HAD WHEN TIMES WERE THE ROUGHEST😮‍💨🔥‼️

Cover my scares with this album ❤

Before HURRY UP TOMORROW dropped I had nothing. No money,No home, barely even a reason to keep going.i was sleeping on a park bench, stomach empty, phone on 2% when the album finally dropped. The second I heard the first note,it Was like the heavens opened. Abel’s voice wrapped me like a warm embrace, telling me to hold a bit longer.By the last track played I wasn’t the same person. The album didn’t save me… It resurrected me.
